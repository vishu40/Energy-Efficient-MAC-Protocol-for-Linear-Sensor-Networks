% MATLAB script to analyze an NS-2/NS-3 trace file
% This script calculates basic metrics like throughput, packet loss, and delay

% Define the trace file path
traceFile = 'path_to_trace_file.tr';

% Open the trace file
fileID = fopen(traceFile, 'r');

% Check if the file opened successfully
if fileID == -1
    error('Error opening the trace file');
end

% Initialize variables
totalPacketsSent = 0;
totalPacketsReceived = 0;
totalPacketsDropped = 0;
totalBytesSent = 0;
totalBytesReceived = 0;
totalDelay = 0;

% Read each line of the trace file
while ~feof(fileID)
    % Read a line from the file
    line = fgetl(fileID);
    
    % Parse the line to extract relevant fields
    % Assume the trace file fields: event, time, src, dst, size
    data = strsplit(line);
    eventType = data{1};
    eventTime = str2double(data{2});
    srcNode = str2double(data{3});
    dstNode = str2double(data{4});
    packetSize = str2double(data{5});
    
    % Process based on the event type
    switch eventType
        case 's' % Send event
            totalPacketsSent = totalPacketsSent + 1;
            totalBytesSent = totalBytesSent + packetSize;
            
        case 'r' % Receive event
            totalPacketsReceived = totalPacketsReceived + 1;
            totalBytesReceived = totalBytesReceived + packetSize;
            % Calculate delay for received packets (simplified example)
            % You need to store the send time to calculate exact delay
            totalDelay = totalDelay + eventTime; % Modify as needed
            
        case 'd' % Drop event
            totalPacketsDropped = totalPacketsDropped + 1;
    end
end

% Close the trace file
fclose(fileID);

% Calculate performance metrics
packetLossRatio = totalPacketsDropped / totalPacketsSent;
averageDelay = totalDelay / totalPacketsReceived;
throughput = (totalBytesReceived * 8) / eventTime; % in bits per second

% Display the results
fprintf('Total Packets Sent: %d\n', totalPacketsSent);
fprintf('Total Packets Received: %d\n', totalPacketsReceived);
fprintf('Total Packets Dropped: %d\n', totalPacketsDropped);
fprintf('Packet Loss Ratio: %.2f\n', packetLossRatio);
fprintf('Average Delay: %.2f seconds\n', averageDelay);
fprintf('Throughput: %.2f bps\n', throughput);
